Guide for Adding Wario Costumes
=======================================================================================

Wario costumes work differently than most characters do. Wario has slot-dependent bones. Using the wrong boneset will crash the game.

Slots 0-5: Use the Biker jacket boneset
Slots 6-11: Use the Classic Wario boneset
Slots 12+: Use the Biker boneset again

If you wish to add further costumes to Wario, please make sure that you use correct bone set for the slots.

MarioDox has patched Classic Wario over Wario Ware boneset fighter files here: http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=217671

We recommend just using one of the existing fighter files, and replacing the textures. You may also fully use the patch by replacing the module (.rel) file for Wario and adding all applicable files so that every Wario costume will use the Wario Ware boneset.

For tag-based costumes, putting a Classic Wario costume over a Biker slot can have uninintended shadow effects, and can crash the game. Using a Biker costume over a Classic slot can have unintended shadow effects.

Additionally, Wario cannot use Costume IDs 15, 31, or 47. These slots will crash when used with Warioman. Higher numbered slots, 48-60, can be used instead.
