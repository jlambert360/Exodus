=======================================================================================

Many PSA -- fighter.pac -- files have been modified to recieve minor cosmetic enhancements
or patched to prevent crashes. No changes to gameplay animations, attributes, frame data,
or non-cosmetic hitbox properties (locations, trajectories, damage, knockback) have occurred.

All edited PSAs use vPM3.6 as a base. Some cosmetic bugs present in vPM3.6 have not
been corrected.
	ex. Samus - Thruster locations for Retro suit rolls or Fusion suit victory

If any differences in gameplay between the modified PSAs and vPM3.6 were accidentally
introduced, please report them as bugs. Any such differences are not representative of
the philosophy or quality of work presented by the Legacy TE development team as a
whole or any of its playtesters.

	1 - Memory Leak Fixes
	2 - Shiny Pokemon
	3 - Team Glow compatibility
	4 - Costume slot dependant effects
	5 - Removed Peach entry files

=======================================================================================
1) The following fighter.pac files have been patched with ds22's memory leak fix.
Some fighters receive additional PSA edits, as noted later. Implemented by ds22 and Yohan1044.
These fixes will prevent certain crashes from prolonged gameplay sessions with these fighters:
	Game & Watch
	Ganondorf
	Kirby
	Lucario
	Mewtwo
	Pit
	ROB
	Snake
	Sonic
	Zero Suit Samus

=======================================================================================
2) All Pokemon received sparkle during their entry animation for their shiny variant(s).
The subaction used for this (1C2-main-entry) is not full, so new slots can be added
with ease. The left entry has been changed to point to the right entry in every case,
so edits to only one location are required to remove or change which costumes are shiny.
This PMDT concept has been implemented by Yohan1044.
	Charizard - Black
	Ivysaur - Green Team
	Jigglypuff - Blue Team (Green-eyed)
	Lucario - Yellow & Red Gi
	Mewtwo - Green Team & Brass Armored
	Pikachu - Red Team & Ash Hat (Red-skinned)
	Squirtle - Purple (Green-shelled)

=======================================================================================
3) For compatibility with Team Glow, characters with "destroy all graphics" instructions
have been modified to avoid destroying Team Glow. Implemented by Yohan1044.
	Diddy - Juggling balls and Shades
	Sonic - Runtrails on side-taunt (redirected for space)
	ROB   - Armtrails on grounded side-B 
	Zelda - Erroneous terminate in the grab-wait

=======================================================================================

5) Removed Peach entry files

Edits to Peach's coding during her entry animation were made to remove her dependency
on Entry files, saving much hard drive space and avoiding crashes when adding costumes
without Entry files. Credit to DukeItOut.
